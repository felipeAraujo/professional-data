    "description": "I completed my Computer Science Bachelor Degree in 2014. I've been working since 2014 as a software developer. I started my career developing using core PHP for 2 years. There I promoted good practices such as the use of debugging and the use of Unit Testing. From 2016 to 2017 I developed using Delphi 4 and Tokyo. Since September 2018 I've been working on IPMedia using primarily PHP and the Laravel Framework, However, I made some maintenance and some codes for study cases on Angular, Python, R, and Nodejs. I am enthusiastic about learning new program languages, algorithms, and good practices. I am the kind that likes to learn more about theory than practice. Sometimes I have to refrain myself in order to take more practical code exercises.",
